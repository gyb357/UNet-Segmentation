# 📑Introduction

## Advanced UNet Architectures with ResNet Backbone
This repository implements multiple UNet-based architectures with ResNet backbones using PyTorch. The models leverage pretrained weights from ResNet to enhance feature extraction in the encoder parts of these architectures. The implementation includes UNet, UNet++, and UNet3+, all of which support ResNet backbones for improved performance on biomedical image segmentation tasks.

## Purpose of the Project
This project focuses on implementing and comparing various UNet architectures, integrating them with powerful ResNet backbones to create high-performance segmentation models. The implementation supports seamless switching between different UNet variants to find the optimal architecture for specific segmentation tasks.

 > [!Note]
 > All implementations (UNet, UNet++, UNet3+) are fully compatible with ResNet backbones of different depths (18, 34, 50, 101, 152).

# 📑Introduction

## UNet with ResNet Backbone
This repository implements a UNet model with a ResNet backbone using PyTorch. The model leverages pretrained weights from ResNet to enhance feature extraction in the encoder part of the UNet architecture. An ensemble model is also provided to combine multiple UNet models for improved performance, making it suitable for various biomedical image segmentation tasks.

## Purpose of the Project
UNet is a popular convolutional neural network architecture for biomedical image segmentation. This implementation focuses on enhancing the standard UNet architecture with ResNet backbones to improve feature extraction capabilities.
